    <p class="about-text">My name is Emily, I'm 29 years old and based in Oslo. I'm currently studying Frontend Development at Noroff, building on my previous experience with a bachelor's degree in Film and TV production from Westerdals. While I currently work in retail, I'm excited to transition into the tech world and explore all the opportunities it holds. I'm curious, passionate about technology, and love diving into everything that involves it!
